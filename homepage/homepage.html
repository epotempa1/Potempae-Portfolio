    <p class="intro"> 
      <br>Hello there!</br>
     <br> I moved to London from Chicago in the fall of 2022 to begin my journey into UX design with a Masters in Human Computer Interaction from City, University of London. I completed my course during the fall of 2023 and during my studies, I became well versed in user centered design including a myriad of user research methods, and technical skills such as: wireframing, prototyping, HTML, CSS, and building user journeys.</br>

     <br>  I enjoy working on projects that benefit and enrich users' lives, and being a life long animal and nature lover, I would welcome the opportunity to apply my skills to projects that focus on conservation.</br>

      <br>Prior to my life in London, I was an American Sign Language Interpreter in Chicago from 2014 to 2022 and therefore have extensive experience working in accessibility for people with disabilities. I'm also an excellent communicator and enjoy working with linguistics, and overall have over a decade of experience working in various customer service roles including retail, hospitality, and reception. </br>
    <br>In my free time I love doing aerial silks and finding a cozy place to read in the sun.
