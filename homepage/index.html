    <p class="intro"> 
      <br>Hello there!</br>
     <br> I moved to London from Chicago in the fall of 2022 to begin my journey into UX design with a Masters in Human Computer Interaction from City, University of London. I completed my course during the fall of 2023 and during my studies, I became well versed in user centered design including a myriad of user research methods, and technical skills such as: wireframing, prototyping, HTML, CSS, and building user journeys.</br>

      <br>Prior to my life in London, I was an American Sign Language Interpreter in Chicago from 2014 to 2022 and therefore have extensive experience working in accessibility for people with disabilities.
