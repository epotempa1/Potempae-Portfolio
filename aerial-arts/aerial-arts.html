    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="challenge-description">
      <p>In 2016 I was looking for a new hobby and decided to try an aerial silks class. I was instantly hooked and           signed myself up for ongoing sessions as soon as I left the studio. </p>
      <p>When I was considering moving to London, the first thing I did was research studios that could potentially             become my new circus home. (Priorities!) I thought about how convenient it would be to have a "one-stop-shop"           for all of my circus needs, which is the purpose for My Circus Hub. </p>
      <p>Designed through interviews with experts in the field and both experienced and novice students, My Circus               Hub is where to go for all your circus needs. Interested in giving an apparatus a go, but have questions?               Looking for a way to enhance your skills on a warm beach for a couple weeks? Or maybe you're moving to a new             city, (or country), and are curious where to continue getting your circus fix. It's all here! </p>

        <h2>Phase One : The Research</h2>
      </div>
        <div class="interviews">
          <h2>Interviews</h2>
         <p> I began this assignment by conducting four semi-structured remote interviews with some circus             friends back in Chicago. Participants included two advanced students with several years of                   experience, and two seasoned teachers. They served as experts in the domain and spent                         approximately half an hour each chatting with me about all things circus. </p>
          <p>Often people will show an interest in the aerial arts, but either do not know how to get more  information, or they convince themselves they're incapable due to lack of experience or physical strength.  For this reason, I was espeically interested in the experts' origin stories and how they got involved with the sport. Additionally, I wanted to understand what type of impact joining aerial had on their lives. </p>

        <h3>Domain Model</h3>
          <p>After analyzing data produced by the interviews, 
            I began by creating a domain model to illustrate key concepts and understand how they intertwined. Some components             were expected, (students, teachers, performances, studios), but what was most exciting, in my opinion, was that                 each person mentioned the positive impact circus had on their lives both mentally and physically. They spoke about how constant practice led to stronger muscles, overcoming fears, and forming supportive, encouraging communities.

          <h3>User Journey</h3>
          <p> A fun component of this sport is the opportunity to go an a retreat! It's a perfect                        chance for an aerialist to 
            combine a vacation with their favorite apparatus as they focus on developing their skills in a tropical paradise, (or forest, etc.) The task for this user journey was to locate a retreat to focuson the silks apparatus. The user lived in the United States and wanted to go to a warm climate not too far from home. </p>
      
          <p>The user is able to begin their search by either typing "silks retreats" in the home search bar, or utilizing the "aerial retreats" tab in the nav bar. From there, they are able to filter based on location, type of environment, and               the amount of time they wish to stay.

            Because I wanted this website to benefit both newcomers and veterans alike, I sought feedback from both groups to understand how people felt the information should be conveyed. To achieve this, I posted a link to a hybrid cardsort in a facebook group for aerialists. </p>
      <p> To test the structure of the sitemap, I recruited aerialists with various levels of experience to complete six tasks and reorganized, reclassified, and omitted information where appropriate. While users were overwhelmingly successful at completing tasks with ease, this evaluation did lead to eliminating some redunancies. </p>

   <h2>Phase Three : Creating Wireframes</h2>
      <div class="wireframes-description">
        <p>I began by sketching out wireframes by hand, and focused more on designing content pages instead of a homepage as users are more likely to land on a webpage from a search engine, as opposed to typing in a URL. Each page strives to keep users on the website longer by encouraging further discoverability. At the bottom of each page, there are links to other facets of the website to keep users more engaged.</p>

          <p>As mentioned, a commonality amongst those I spoke to was the positive impact one may experience when joining the circus community. While I showcased that with this wireframe, other information that would be found under the "Information for Beginners" navigation are FAQs and safety information.

    <h3>Apparatus Research Page</h3>
    <p>  It's rather common for someone with no circus experience to not know the names for the apparatuses. They may see a brilliant performance and think, "I want to learn how to do that," but aren't sure what to look up. Here, users can browse through a list of apparatuses to find one that's most appealing to them.

      <h3>Aerial Retreats</h3>
      <p> Doing nothing but silks on a warm beach sounds like a dream to me, and aerial retreats just like that are farily            common in the circus community. It may be challenging to find the perfect fit, however, when there's no singular               database and the only option is to sift through google results. This section of My Circus Hub addressed just that!</p>
      <p> Here, aerialists looking for a productive getaway can filter based on how long they'd like to stay, which apparatus         they'd like to focus on, or their budget, (to name a few options).</p>

       <h3>Find a Studio</h3>
       <p> I know this would have come in handy when I migrated to London! Aerialists looking for their new circus home, or maybe a temporary one to keep their skills sharp while they're away, could filter based on their location or apparatus of choice, (not all studios offer each apparatus). Similar to aerial retreats, this eliminates sifting through endless google searches and enables users to see all available options in one location.

      <h2>Phase Four : Wireframe Evaluation</h2>
    </div>
      <p>To follow best practices, I evaluated these wireframes by conducting a moderated study with both beginners and veteran aerialists, as they are who the product was designed for. Additionally, I opted to use paper prototypes as their lack of "frills" allow users to navigate the content without distraction, and therefore tend to lead to more honest feedback.
     To evaluate label clarity, I asked participants to tell me what they expected to find under each tab in the top hierarchy, and to explain their thought process out loud. </p>
    <p> I also created findability tasks and catered them to each participant based on their experience level. For beginners, I asked them to use the paper wireframes to figure out what attire would be most appropriate for their upcoming class, and I asked the experienced participant to follow the user journey and find a way to get information about a vacation focused on aerial silks, in a warm location near the United States, and also find an aerial studio in Chicago. </p>
    <p>While overall, participants were able to successfully guess the information each navigation tab would entail, I noticed during this stage that all individuals assumed there would be some information there that I had not thought to include. For example, two inexperienced members mentioned they expected, (and wanted to know more) about the safety of aerial arts, and whether there are certain health conditions that would exclude someone from safely participating. Another user said they were confused by the "Information for Instructors and Studios," tab as the word 'studios' in this context implied there would be information about specific classes there. Lastly, the experienced aerialist I spoke to thought "About Aerial Arts" would contain information about how an aerialist could begin their career and gain industry experience.</p>

      <h2>Phase Five : Reflection</h2>
    </div>
      <p>While I had considered adding components of safety to this project, I chose not to because none of the original interviewees brought it up. Quite the contrary, as many of them mentioned safety was not a concern when they first joined aerial. The two participants who brought it up during evaluations, however, were adamant that this would be information they would need to read more about before considering giving the aerial arts a try. Due to the level of importance this held for them, I would go back into the sitemap and create another category alongside "FAQs" and "Perks of Joining Aerial" to ensure this information is easy to find. Additionally, I would edit the "Aerial Info for Beginners," to include a link at the bottom of the page directing beginners to health and safety information. </p>
      <p>I would also follow-up on the confusion surrounding the "Information for Instructors and Studios," perhaps either by evaluating with more users to see how often the issue arises, or an A/B test with other wording to see which is clearer to users. </p>
