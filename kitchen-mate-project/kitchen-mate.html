      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="challenge-description">
        <p>For Interaction Design I worked in a group of five other people to create
          a cooking app for the Amazon Echo Show called, "Kitchen Mate." Kitchen Mate aimed to
          guide users to a healthier, more sustainable way of life.
          We conducted several observations and interviews to gain a comprehensive understanding
          about diet, cooking, and lifestyle habits. The data was used as a guidance for the duration of the project
          to maintain a user-centered approach to design.</p>

        <div class="interviews-and-observations">
          
          <h3>Interviews and Observations</h3>
         <p class="research"> KitchenMate's design was guided by data gathered from semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiries. Following a collaborative brainstorming             session, we created a list of open-ended questions to serve as a guide for the interviewing process. Topics of interest centered on: cooking habits, grocery shopping                 routines, dietary requirements, and sustainability. Interviews were one on one, occured both remotely and in person, and were under an hour long. </p> 

            <p class="research"> Contextual Inquiries allowed us to have a dialogue with our participants as we observed them preparing and cooking meals. During these sessions,                   we documented any pertenent comments, behaviors, and frustrations, and would ask probing or clarifiying questions when appropriate. Inquiries occurred in various                   settings including: a student hall kitchen and a single family home.

        <h2>Phase Two : Analyzing the Data</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Each member of the group began the analysis by familiarizing themselves with the data individually, paying attention to key insights. Afterwards, we reconvened to discuss our findings and organized our thoughts into an affinity diagram to identify overlaps amongst our findings. Some common themes we identified included: the desire to quick and easy meals, simple nutrition tracking, and preferring online recipes over hardcopy books.</p>
        <p>We then moved on to developing an empathy map, to organize what our users think, do, feel,and say. This gave us a clear starting point and served as a foundation to our personas. </p>

        <p>The data gathered from our semis-tructured interviews and observations
        were used to bring our two personas, Maria and Brian, to life. From our data, we realized there were two different types of users: one who is already knowledgeable about the ins and outs of a healthy lifestyle, and one who is at the beginning stages of their journey.

           <p>Brian is a former athlete already well versed in fitness and nutrition. His hectic schedule as an arbitrator in London, however, has limited his capactiy to maintain that lifestyle and he's frustrated that he feels he must choose between a healthy meal and something delicious. Ideally he doesn't want to spend more than twenty minutes cooking a meal, and wants a variety of healthy and delicious options that meet his nutritional goals.  </p>

She feels overwhelmed though and doesn't know where to start when looking for replacement products, and misses meals she used to enjoy but had to give up because they are not vegan. She doesn't mind spending more time cooking her meals and likes the idea of tracking her vitamins and minerals.

          <p>We started this stage by independently brainstorming ideas to solve user pain points and presented them to the group via sketches, each group member having three to four             ideas. From there, we moved onto storyboarding where we more clearly outlined how KitchenMate could address these painpoints. Because our prior research indicated that                 people tend to struggle reading nutritional information on the packaging, the first journey we illustrated depicted a consumer in a grocery store scanning a food item to               gain further information (calorie information, vegetarian vs. vegan product, etc.). The second focused on how users could take advantage of KitchenMate's extensive                   recipe library as they browsed to find one that most suited their needs. </p>

This user flow shows how people can search for and carry out a recipe with KitchenMate. After choosing a meal, the recipe will be displayed step-by-step on a secondary screen. For those with full or messy hands, (which happens to the best of us when cooking), they can interact with KitchenMate through voice commands, telling it to move onto the next step, or go back a step if they need to clarify. This simple and straight forward design alleviated another pain point expressed by users: getting lost or confused in extensive texts</p>

        <h3>Recipe Page</h3>
    <p>A common theme shared amongst our interviewees was the desire to search for recipes online. This lead to the development of a core element for KitchenMate: a library of recipes. When viewing their options, users will see familiar features such as a list of ingredients, cook time, and nutritional facts about the meal (vegan, high protein, nut free, etc.). They can broaden or narrow their search by adjusting these filters or the slider signifying cook time. This can be accomplished manually either through Echo Show’s touch screen, or by voice command. This was a crucial attribute to include in our final product as our user research indicated that no two individuals’ cooking habits are alike. We wanted to ensure our product would appeal to both those who enjoy spending hours in the kitchen, and people who prefer to allocate their time elsewhere.  .</p>

        <h3>Testing with Users</h3>
        </div>
        <p> At the beginning of the test, we explained the purpose of KitchenMate and the evaluation, discussed consent, and asked if they had any questions. Once testing had completed, we asked users open-ended questions about their overall experience with KitchenMate. We wanted to know what they enjoyed, disliked, and what they would like to see change. </p>
        <p>User testing showed the app was clear and easy to navigate as each participant accomplished the tasks in less than five minutes. Additionally, they praised KitchenMate's intuitiveness, emphasizing the familiarity of icons and available filters. We were moderately concerned that the placement of the "Add to Grocery List" button may stir confusion. In our original markups it was placed next to the recipe ingredients, but for testing we placed it next to the "Cook Now" button instead. Thankfully, participants experience no frustration or confusion due to this placement. </p>

           <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
         </div>
        <p>While we were overall satisfied with our design and felt it successfully addressed all pain points discovered in our research, we felt it could have been improved had we added more cues or suggesting recipes for those indecisive users. Additionally, we could have taken advantage of the Echo Show's larger screen size by adding more dimensionality to our designs and layouts, instead of relying on a traditional grid pattern. Additionally, the lack of an explicit "final" screen to indicate the user had completed certain tasks, (cooking a meal, for example) could lead to some confusion.</p>
        <p>Due to time and resource constraints, we had three observers for one contextual enquiry of two people which could have led our recruits to stray from their natural behavior. While having multiple researchers present may have alleviated concerns of observer bias, having a maximum of two researchers present would have been ideal. </p>
